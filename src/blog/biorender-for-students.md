# Create innovative and eye-catching illustrations using BioRender

U of T students can access BioRender, a scientific illustration software, through their university affiliation to create figures for academic purposes such as presentations, posters, and theses.

## Students can access BioRender at discounted pricing in four ways:

  1. **Free:** No fee but you are limited by the number of figures you can create in addition to poor quality of export images and the inability to use figures for publication.
   
  2. **Individual Membership:** $35 month (if paid annually) or $39 per month for a monthly subscription. Unlimited figures, great resolution of export images, and license to publish figures. However, only the individual with the account can work on the figures without team collaboration.
   
  3. **Lab Membership:** $99 month (if paid annually) or $129 per month for a monthly subscription. All individual plan features that make team collaboration possible such as sharing folders. 
   
  4. **Institution:** Please check with your department admin to find out if the department offers discounts to access BioRender. This varies from time-to-time.
