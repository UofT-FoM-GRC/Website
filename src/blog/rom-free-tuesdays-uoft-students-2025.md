  Full-time UofT students get free admission to the Royal Ontario Museum every Tuesday. Just show your student ID at the ticket desk.
</div>

## How It Works

**When:** Every Tuesday during regular museum hours

**Who:** Full-time post-secondary students

**What you need:** Valid student ID (your TCard works)

**Where:** Royal Ontario Museum, 100 Queens Park, Toronto

Walk up to the ticket desk on any Tuesday, show your student ID, and you're in. That's it.

## What's Included

Free admission covers the permanent collections, which include:

- Natural history exhibits (dinosaurs, minerals, gems)
- World cultures galleries (Ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, Asia, the Americas)
- Art and design collections
- The Bat Cave (always a crowd favorite)

<div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 text-yellow-700 p-4 my-4 rounded">
  ⚠️ Special exhibitions sometimes require an additional fee, even on Tuesdays. Check the ROM website before visiting if there's a specific exhibit you want to see.
</div>

## Just FYI

Tuesdays can get busy since this deal is available to all post-secondary students, not just UofT. Going earlier in the day (right when they open) or later in the afternoon tends to be less crowded.

The museum cafe is decent if you want to grab a coffee or lunch there, though you're obviously paying regular prices for food.

Not a bad perk for being a student. The ROM's regular admission is around $23.
