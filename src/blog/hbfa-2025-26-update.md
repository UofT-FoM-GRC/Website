The Harmonized Base Funding Agreement (HBFA) has been updated for the 2025-26 academic year. Whether you're just starting out or you've been around for a while, there are some changes worth knowing about.

## What's New This Year

If you've been here a while, here's what changed: there's now a **$5,000 top-up** for students who receive cumulative awards between $40,000 and $45,000. Previously, the maximum top-up was $4,000. This new tier recognizes students who secure substantial external funding.

## Base Funding for 2025-26

Here's what you can expect as your base stipend depending on your program and residency status:

| Program | Living Allowance | Tuition & Fees | UHIP | **Total Base Funding** |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|------|---------------------|
| **Domestic MSc** (2024-25) | $29,819.88 | $9,438.48 | — | **$39,258.36** |
| **Domestic MSc** (2025-26) | $29,819.88 | $9,608.48 | — | **$39,428.36** |
| **Domestic PhD** | $32,910.48 | $8,448.48 | — | **$41,358.96** |
| **International MSc** | $29,819.88 | $34,108.48 | $756.00 | **$64,684.36** |
| **International PhD** | $32,910.48 | $8,448.48 | $756.00 | **$42,114.96** |

Your base funding includes everything you need to cover tuition, fees, and living expenses. For domestic MSc students, there's a small increase in tuition and fees this year (about $170 more).

## How Scholarship Top-Ups Actually Work

When you receive external scholarships, you might think your total funding becomes base funding plus scholarship. That's not quite how it works. Instead, your scholarship goes toward covering your base funding, and you receive a top-up as a reward for securing external money.

Here's the complete breakdown:

| Your Total Scholarship Amount | What Happens | Top-Up Amount |
|-------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| $0 to $2,000 | You keep the full amount. It doesn't reduce your base funding. | No top-up |
| $2,001 to $9,999 | Goes toward base funding | **$2,000 top-up** |
| $10,000 to $15,000 | Goes toward base funding | **$3,000 top-up** |
| $15,001 to $39,999 | Goes toward base funding | **$4,000 top-up** |
| **$40,000 to $45,000** | **Goes toward base funding** | **$5,000 top-up** ⭐ *New!* |
| $45,001 to $50,000 | You keep up to $50,000 total | No top-up |
| Over $50,000 | You can only keep $50,000 | No top-up |

### A Real Example

Let's say you're a domestic PhD student with base funding of $41,358.96. You apply for and receive a $42,000 CIHR scholarship. Here's what happens:

- Your base funding ($41,358.96) gets covered by the scholarship
- You receive a $5,000 top-up because your award is in the $40,000 to $45,000 range
- **Your total funding = $41,358.96 + $5,000 = $46,358.96**

The scholarship essentially pays for your base funding, and the top-up is your reward for bringing external money to the university.

### The Fine Print Gotchas

    Not all money counts as a scholarship for top-up purposes. The following do <b>NOT</b> qualify for top-ups:
    <ul>
        <li>University of Toronto Fellowships (including departmental fellowships)</li>
        <li>Doctoral Completion Awards</li>
        <li>Temerty Faculty of Medicine Entrance Scholarships</li>
        <li>GSS (Graduate Student Supplement) funds</li>
        <li>Travel awards</li>
        <li>Bursaries</li>
    </ul>

## How Long Does Funding Last?

Your guaranteed funding depends on your program path:

- **MSc students**: 2 years
- **Direct-entry PhD**: 5 years
- **PhD with completed master's**: 4 years
- **MSc to PhD transfer**: 5 years total (including your MSc year)

All of this assumes you remain in good standing academically.

## Use this Information for GEMS

When you're filling out your Graduate Education Management System (GEMS) budget, use the base funding table at the top of this article. Your "Guaranteed Base Funding" row should match the total from the table for your specific situation (domestic vs international, MSc vs PhD).

We hope this breakdown helps you understand the HBFA changes for 2025-26. If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out to us at the GRC. We're here to help you navigate this.
