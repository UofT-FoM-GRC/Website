# Trying to Study While Keeping an Eye on Your Kids? We've Got You

Being a grad student at UofT is hard enough. Being a parent at the same time feels like climbing Everest.

You need to get work done, but finding childcare for every library session? Not always possible or affordable. The good news is UofT finally gets it. They’ve created a **Family Study Space at Robarts Library**.

## So What's Different About This Space?

Think of it as a study room meets playroom. It’s located on the 9th floor (room 9002) of Robarts Library. Here’s what you’ll find:

- Computer stations for your research work
- Toys, books, and activities to keep kids entertained
- Chalkboard and whiteboard for creative play or impromptu teaching moments

It’s a space that understands your reality as both a parent and a student.

## Who Can Use It?

This space is open to UofT students, faculty, visiting scholars, and staff who bring their children (12 years old or under) to Robarts Library.

## How to Get Access

[Register using this form to get your key-fob for access to the space](http://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforms.office.com%2Fr%2FM7E9GMurvs&data=05%7C01%7Ckristy.wheaton%40utoronto.ca%7Cf34e93d99aa8429b70d508da876b9e75%7C78aac2262f034b4d9037b46d56c55210%7C0%7C0%7C637971193525776107%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=FruIIpGZIMVEmhiX2hz%2FStlqNLo4susG1pOCNKOV8d8%3D&reserved=0)

## A Few House Rules

Nothing too strict, just the basics to keep things safe and comfortable for everyone:

- You need to stay with your kids (12 and under). **This isn’t drop-off childcare**
- You are 100% responsible for your children’s safety and behavior
- Clean up after yourselves—wipe the whiteboard, toss your trash, leave it nice for the next family
- Use regular library washrooms for diaper changes
- Leave the space 30 minutes before the library closes

Break these rules and you might lose access, so let’s all play nice.
